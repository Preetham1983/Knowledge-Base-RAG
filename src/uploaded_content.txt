Hi I am Dinesh, I have been in Python practice for almost a year now.  
 
0:04 
I am I will go to share my experience with how I learned AI and we have multiple accelerators in 
Python practice and one such accelerator is ART.  
 
0:11 
In ART we do reverse engineering of code bases to create documentation and this is where I learnt 
about Landgraf and all the other agentic AI frameworks and this is where I got my of AI to be strong.  
 
0:24 
After this accelerator, we started on a new accelerator called Raven.  
 
0:28 
In Raven we tried to mitigate vulnerabilities that are there in code basis and that is where I was able to 
architect and design AI agent workflows and I got a better grip on AI.

And if you are interested in AI, if you want to contribute and learn more on AI, then we do have 
multiple other accelerators and this is a good place where you can start to learn AI.  
 
0:48 
And from this, there are opportunity to become available as well in other projects.  
 
0:52 
And we do have multiple other accelerators if you are interested.  
 
0:56 
Then there is also a weekly Chai meeting that we have on every week.  
 
1:00 
And this meeting we talk about what are good things that we do in AI.  
 
1:03 
And if you are interested, please join us in contributing to all these activities.

Yeah, thanks.
